## mf_dispobj_spaceshoot

This is a collection of javaScript files that have to do with display objects that are to be used in a space shooter type game rather than something that is turned based. When it comes to a typical space shooter type game I find that display objects should be updated by way of a current heading, and a pixels per second value. This is the way that display objects are treated when it comes to what I have worked out here.
